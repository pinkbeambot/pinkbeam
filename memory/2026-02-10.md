# 2026-02-10 - Pink Beam Development Session

## Major Fixes Completed

### 1. Solutions Service Light/Dark Mode Fix
**Issue:** /solutions page was not respecting light/dark mode - showing white text on white background or dark backgrounds in light mode.

**Root Causes Found:**
- `SolutionsPageClient.tsx` had `bg-gradient-void` on `<main>` wrapper - this hardcoded dark gradient
- `SolutionsLayout.tsx` had `bg-background` on layout wrapper (AgentsLayout doesn't have this)
- Section components used hardcoded `bg-[#0A0A0F]` and `text-white` instead of theme-aware classes

**Fixes Applied:**
- Removed `bg-gradient-void` from SolutionsPageClient main wrapper
- Removed `bg-background` from SolutionsLayout to match other service layouts
- Changed all section backgrounds to `bg-background`
- Changed card backgrounds to `bg-card` 
- Changed borders to `border-border`
- Changed text to `text-foreground`
- Fixed grid backgrounds (cyan -> amber for Solutions)
- Fixed Open Graph image colors (cyan -> amber)

### 2. Standardized Scroll Indicators
**Issue:** /agents and / (hub) scroll indicators used framer-motion and didn't match other services.

**Pattern Established:**
```tsx
<div className="absolute bottom-8 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2 flex flex-col items-center gap-2 text-muted-foreground">
  <span className="text-xs uppercase tracking-wider">Scroll</span>
  <ChevronDown className="w-5 h-5 text-{service-color} animate-bounce" />
</div>
```

**Service Colors:**
- Agents/Hub: `text-pink-500`
- Solutions: `text-amber-400`
- Labs: `text-cyan-400`
- Web: `text-violet-400`

### 3. Git Checkpoint
Commit `de81e58` pushed to GitHub with all theme fixes and standardizations.

## Key Learnings

**Theme System Architecture:**
- Layout wrappers should NOT have background colors (let body handle it)
- Section components should use `bg-background` for theme adaptability
- Cards should use `bg-card` and `border-border`
- Text should use `text-foreground` (not `text-white` or `text-black`)
- `bg-gradient-void` is a hardcoded dark gradient - only use in hero sections intentionally

**Color Strategy:**
Each service has an accent color that appears in:
- Hero backgrounds/effects
- Scroll indicator arrows
- Badges and CTAs
- Icons

But all pages share the same `bg-background` base for content sections.

## Files Modified (Key Ones)
- `app/(solutions)/solutions/SolutionsPageClient.tsx`
- `app/(solutions)/solutions/layout.tsx`
- `app/(solutions)/solutions/components/*` (all section components)
- `components/agents/sections/Hero.tsx`
- `app/(main)/components/Hero.tsx`

## Open Questions/Issues
None - all theme issues resolved and standardized across services.

### Endpoint Audit Subagent Launched
Started comprehensive endpoint documentation task:
- Subagent scanning entire codebase for all page.tsx and route.ts files
- Will document: URL, user journey, prerequisites, API calls, actions, navigation paths
- Includes: public pages, auth flows, dashboards, admin panels, API endpoints
- Output: `~/obsidian/pinkbeam/ENDPOINT-AUDIT.md` plus individual service files
- Purpose: Enable human audit visiting every endpoint to verify functionality
